# Extended JSON Schema validators

Originally, validation tools were available in this repository. They
have been recently moved to [their own repository](//github.com/inab/extended-json-schema-validators/),
so dependency and package management is simplified.

The validation tools are at:

https://github.com/inab/extended-json-schema-validators/
