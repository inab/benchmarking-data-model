# Extended JSON Schema validators

Originally, validation tools were available in this repository. They
were moved to [their own repository](//github.com/inab/extended-json-schema-validators/),
so dependency and package management is simplified.

Later, that repo was forked to add the extensions currently being used by FAIRTracks Validator, at [fairtracks_validator](//github.com/fairtracks/fairtracks_validator/).

Last, the python implementation gained its own repository, hosted at [python-extended-json-schema-validator](//github.com/inab/python-extended-json-schema-validator/).
