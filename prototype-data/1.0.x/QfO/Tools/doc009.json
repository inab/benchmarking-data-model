An InParanoid cluster is seeded by a reciprocally bestmatching ortholog pair, around which inparalogs are gathered independently, while outparalogs are excluded.  The InParanoid database is a collection of pairwise ortholog groups aiming to include all 'completely sequenced' eukaryotic genomes. By this we mean above 6X coverage, and less than 1% X letters in the protein sequences. Two variants were tested in this study: this one is the high-confidence set including only orthologs with InParanoid's maximum confidence score of 1.0","references":["doi:10.1093/nar/gku1203"],"status":"online","name":"InParanoidCore","is_automated":true,"tool_access":[{"techdocs":[{"uri":"https://github.com/fabsta/Hieranoid/blob/master/inparanoid.pl","label":"source"}],"tool_access_type":"command-line","link":"http://software.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/request.cgi?project=inparanoid"},{"link":"http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se.","tool_access_type":"Web","techdocs":[{"uri":"http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/download/current/relnotes.txt","label":"doc"}]},{"link":"http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/download/","tool_access_type":"other","techdocs":[{"uri":"http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/download/8.0_current/","label":"source"}]}],"_id":"QfO:InParanoidCore","registry_tool_id":"biotools:inparanoid","tool_contact_ids":["Erik.Sonnhammer","Inparanoid.MailingList"],"community_ids":["OEBC002"]}
