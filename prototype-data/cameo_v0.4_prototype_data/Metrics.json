To unequivocally identify the residues of all protein chains in complexes, QS-score first establishes a mapping between equivalent polypeptide chains of the compared structures by exploiting complex symmetries where possible. The resulting QS-score expresses the fraction of shared interface contacts (residues on different chains with a Cβ-Cβ distance < 12 Å) between two assemblies. A  QS-score close to 1 translates to very similar interfaces, matching stoichiometry and a majority of identical interfacial contacts. A QS-score close to 0 indicates a radically diverse quaternary structure, indicating different stoichiometries and potentially representing alternative binding conformations.", "links" : [ { "uri" : "SUBMITTED", "label" : "QS-SCORE publication" } ], "references" : [ "SUBMITTED" ] }
