    "title": "MM-align (MultiMer-align) is an algorithm for structurally aligning multiple-chain protein-protein complexes.",
    "description": "The algorithm is built on a heuristic iteration of a modified Needleman-Wunsch dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, with the alignment score specified by the inter-complex residue distances. The assignment of matching multiple chains in each complex rely on our chain mapping alogrithm. [DOI:]. Values range between 0 (bad) and 100 (good).",

    "formal_definition": "QS-score considers the assembly interface as a whole and is suitable for comparing homo- or hetero-oligomers with identical or different stoichiometries, alternative relative orientations of chains, and distinct amino acid sequences (i.e. homologous complexes). To unequivocally identify the residues of all protein chains in complexes, QS-score first establishes a mapping between equivalent polypeptide chains of the compared structures by exploiting complex symmetries where possible. The resulting QS-score expresses the fraction of shared interface contacts (residues on different chains with a Cβ-Cβ distance < 12 Å) between two assemblies. A  QS-score close to 1 translates to very similar interfaces, matching stoichiometry and a majority of identical interfacial contacts. A QS-score close to 0 indicates a radically diverse quaternary structure, indicating different stoichiometries and potentially representing alternative binding conformations.",
