		"title": "A new contact area difference-based function for evaluation of protein structural models"
		"description": "The CAD score (contact area difference) provides a single uniform framework for assessing single-domain, multi-domain, and even multi-subunit protein structural models of varying degree of accuracy and completeness. CAD-score emphasizes the physical realism of models and is superposition-free. Values ranges between 0 and 1 (0 bad, 1 good).",

		"formal_definition": "CAD-score is a new evaluation function quantifying differences between physical contacts in a model and the reference structure. The new score uses the concept of residue–residue contact area difference (CAD) introduced by Abagyan and Totrov (J Mol Biol 1997; 268:678–685). Contact areas, the underlying basis of the score, are derived using the Voronoi tessellation of protein structure. The newly introduced CAD-score is a continuous function, confined within fixed limits, free of any arbitrary thresholds or parameters. ",
