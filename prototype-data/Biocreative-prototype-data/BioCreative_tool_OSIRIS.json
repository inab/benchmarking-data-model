	"description": "Sequence variants, in particular Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), are considered key elements in fields such as genetic epidemiology and pharmacogenomics [Palmer and Cardon, 2005]. Researchers in these areas are interested in finding genes associated with diseases or with drug responses, as well as in selecting the relevant sequence variants on candidate genes for genotyping studies. Several public databases are available containing sequence information on genes and proteins (NCBI Entrez, SwissProt and many others). Data on sequence variants can be found at other public resources such as NCBI dbSNP and HapMap. In contrast, information about phenotypic consequences of the sequence variants of genes is generally found as non-structured text in the biomedical literature. However, the identification of the relevant documents and the extraction of the information from them are often hampered by the lack of widely accepted standard notation for genes, proteins and sequence variants in the biomedical literature, and by the large size of current literature databases. Bearing this in mind, automatic systems for the identification of gene\/protein entities and their corresponding sequence variants from biomedical texts are required. Our group have previously reported the development of OSIRIS, a search system that integrates different sources of information and incorporates ad-hoc tools for synonymy generation with the aim of retrieving literature about sequence variation of a gene using PubMed search engine. We have developed a new version of OSIRIS as a first step towards an integrated text mining system for the extraction of information about genes, sequence variants and related phenotypes. The new implementation of OSIRIS (OSIRISv1.2) incorporates a new entity recognition module and is built on top of a local mirror of MEDLINE collection and HgenetInfoDB. HgenetInfoDB is a database that integrates data of human genes from the NCBI Gene database and dbSNP. The entity recognition module is based on a corpus of articles annotated with gene identifiers and the new search algorithm, which uses a pattern-based search strategy and a sequence variant nomenclature dictionary for the identification of terms denoting SNPs and other sequence variants and their mapping to dbSNP entries. The use of OSIRISv1.2 generates a corpus of annotated literature linked to sequence database entries (NCBI Gene and dbSNP). The results of the searches are stored in a database that can be used to query the results and, in the future, for the extraction of relationships among biological entities. The performance of OSIRISv1.2 was evaluated on a manually annotated corpus, resulting in a 99 % precision at a 82 % recall, and a F-score of 0.9.",
