	"abstract": "MOTIVATION:The initial step in many orthology inference methods is the computationally demanding establishment of all pairwise protein similarities across all analysed proteomes. The quadratic scaling with proteomes has become a major bottleneck. A remedy is offered by the Hieranoid algorithm which reduces the complexity to linear by hierarchically aggregating ortholog groups from InParanoid along a species tree.RESULTS: We have further developed the Hieranoid algorithm in many ways. Major improvements have been made to the construction of multiple sequence alignments and consensus sequences. Hieranoid version 2 was evaluated with standard benchmarks that reveal a dramatic increase in the coverage/accuracy tradeoff over version 1, such that it now compares favourably with the best methods. The new parallelized cluster mode allows Hieranoid to be run on large data sets in a much shorter timespan than InParanoid, yet at similar accuracy."
