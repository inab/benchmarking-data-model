# EXCELERATE WP2 Benchmarking prototype data sets

This directory contains several prototype data sets:

* [cameo_prototype_data](cameo_prototype_data): Sample data set from [CAMEO](https://www.cameo3d.org/), which contains several inconsistencies, so you can get used with the error reporting messages from the reference validation programs.

* [cameo_prototype_data_fixed](cameo_prototype_data_fixed): Sample data set from [CAMEO](https://www.cameo3d.org/), fixed in order to pass all the validation tests against the benchmarking JSON schemas.

* [QfO-prototype-data](QfO-prototype-data): Sample data set from [Quest for Orthologs](http://questfororthologs.org/).

* [Biocreative-prototype-data](Biocreative-prototype-data): Sample data set from [Biocreative/Becalm](http://www.becalm.eu/). Under development.

* [CAPRI_prototype_data](CAPRI_prototype_data): Sample data set from [CAPRI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/capri/capri.html) experiment.
