# EXCELERATE WP2 JSON Schema validation

The reference EXCELERATE WP2 validation and consistency check tools are hosted in this directory. They were designed to work on complete sets of JSON files, spread over several directories.

You can use any of the reference implementations (currently [Perl 5](perl5), [Python 2.x / 3.x](python) and [Java 8](java)), as any of them should do the same validations and consistency checks than the others.
